# USDA_API

This is a project that I created to retrieve information from the USDA website. 
The nutritional information is long and extensive, but not all the information was needed. This was created to get only the nutrition facts needed for ChefTec.
The order of the information is set up differently in ChefTec than the USDA website. Also reorganized the list to match Cheftec.
Below are the nutrients and information needed from USDA.
For a good representation of what it looks like check out this note book first:<br>
